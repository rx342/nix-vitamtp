# nix-vitamtp

Packaging [codestation/vitamtp](https://github.com/codestation/vitamtp) with Nix.

It might work using a different source code (_e.g._ [yifanlu/VitaMTP](https://github.com/yifanlu/VitaMTP) or other forks) but I did not try it.
It is mainly written to be used with [rx342/nix-qcma](https://github.com/rx342/nix-qcma).

Tested on `x86_64-linux`.

```bash
# ⬇️ clone
git clone https://github.com/rx342/nix-vitamtp.git
cd nix-vitamtp

# ⚒️ build
nix-build
```
